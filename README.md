# Polyglot Learning Repository

Welcome to my Polyglot Learning Repository! 🚀

This repository serves as my playground for exploring different programming languages like Java, C++, C, and Rust. As a JavaScript developer, I'm diving into new territories to broaden my skills and understanding of diverse programming paradigms.

## Languages Explored

- **C**
- **Rust**

## Project Structure

./

## How to Run

Each language folder contains its own README.md with instructions on how to run the sample code. Feel free to explore and try out the programs!

## Contributions

If you have suggestions, improvements, or want to add examples in other languages, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn together!

Happy Coding! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
